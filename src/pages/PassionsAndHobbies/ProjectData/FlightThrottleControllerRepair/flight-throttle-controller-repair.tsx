  title: 'PC Flight Throttle Electronics Repair',
  worker: 'Nic',
  category: 'Electronics',

  shortDescription: 'Rewiring and repairing the internal electronics of a vintage PC flight throttle controller to bring it back to life.',
  detailedDescription: `This project involves completely rewiring the internal electronics of an old PC flight throttle that stopped working. The original potentiometers had worn out and several connections had corroded over time. 

The goal is to replace the internal components with modern equivalents while maintaining the original external appearance and feel. This includes installing new potentiometers, updating the wiring harness, and potentially adding USB connectivity if the original serial connection proves problematic.

The throttle has sentimental value as it was used for countless hours of flight simulation, so restoring it to working condition feels like bringing back a piece of gaming history.`,
