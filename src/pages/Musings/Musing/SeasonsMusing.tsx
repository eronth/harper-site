      I have a personal theory, untested and unproven, that humans need the changing of seasons.
      I'm not claiming they need the specific changes (e.g., specific weather patterns), 
      but rather the overall transition and the feelings it evokes. We need our years to be broken
      up into distinct periods, each with its own character and mood.
      <br /><br />
      These days, with our climate controlled homes, it can be easy to isolate from the 
      normal signs of the changing of seasons. Then, with corporate and commercial interests,
      decorations for the <i>next</i> season often appear well before the current one has ended
      (or even begun).
      <br /><br />
      With everything muddled up, it's hard to get properly excited for the current or next season.
      Here I'll list my thoughts on the current seasons (and holidays) and the type of stuff I do to
      help keep them distinct and special.
      <br /><br />
      I try to keep a few rules for how to "experience" a season.
      {/* <ul>
        <li>
          Spring - March, April, May
          Summer - June, July, August
          Fall - September, October, November
          Winter - December, January, February
        </li>
        <li>
          I should try to focus on enjoying the current season.
        </li>
        <li>
          The third month of a season should be focused on that season, I am permitted
          to begin looking forward to the next season. The third month is the transition
          period.
        </li>
        <li>
          The third month of a season is also a great time to "catch up" on any seasonal things
          I feel like I missed out on. Almost a "catch up" month.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid enjoying seasonal foods before the first day of the season.
        </li>
      </ul> */}
      AAAAAAH. Focus on the season at hand, and only start looking forward to the next season
      during the third month of the current season. Appreciate the seasonal things and "work with"
      the annoying parts of the season. For example, in the winter, I can enjoy the sights of snowfall
      with a hot drink in hand â€” I need not actually be in the snow to enjoy it. Same goes for rainfall,
      where I can appreciate the sound and smell of it from indoors.
      <br /><br />
      Firstly, food and drink are a big part of humans and culture, regardless of origin. Tying a few
      foods and drinks to a season helps me get into the mood of that season. A fantastic example is
      pumpkin spice in the fall. I try to avoid them before the first day of the season. I can get excited
      for them, but I try to avoid indulging in them until the season actually starts. This helps lock some
      scents and tastes to the season and really enhances the overall experience. It makes the foods
      that much more exciting and special.
